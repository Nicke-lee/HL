**** Instructions ****

To begin, choose the number of rounds and either customise
the game parameters or go with the default game (where the
secret number will be between 1 and 100)

Then choose how many rounds you'd like to play <enter> for infinite mode.

Your goal is to try to guess the secret number without running out 
of guesses.

Good Luck.
